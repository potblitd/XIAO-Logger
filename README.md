The lack of a simple and cost-effective device to measure temperature and humidity autonomously in remote, outdoor locations is astonishing. Specifically in ecological studies, to collect data, researchers often use the [Ibutton](https://www.ibuttonlink.com/collections/thermochron) logger that was released some 20 years ago and comes at a starting price of 36.70 USD. Needless to say, with today’s rise of CMOS, SoC, IoT and B2C, it’s about time to give those poor government-funded researchers an alternative and open-source solution for a simple temperature and humidity logging device. It should be noted that this post does not describe a buyable product but rather an easy setup with minimal components and cost, hence DIYbutton.
